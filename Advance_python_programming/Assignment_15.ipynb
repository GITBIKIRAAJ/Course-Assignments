    "`Python 3.8` is a major release of Python, and it includes a number of new features and improvements. Some of the notable new features in Python 3.8 include:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Assignment expressions`: Python 3.8 introduces a new syntax for assignment expressions, which allow you to use the := operator to assign a value to a variable as part of an expression. This can make it easier to write concise and readable code, especially when working with complex expressions or when using list comprehensions or generator expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Positional-only parameters`: Python 3.8 introduces a new syntax for defining positional-only parameters in functions, which allows you to specify that some parameters can only be passed using their position, and not using keyword arguments. This can be useful for improving the readability and maintainability of your code, especially when you want to discourage the use of certain keyword arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Typing enhancements`: Python 3.8 includes a number of improvements to the typing module, including the ability to specify the types of variables in function annotations, and the ability to use the Union and Literal types to define more flexible and expressive type hints.\n",
    "\n",
    "`f-strings improvements`: Python 3.8 includes a number of improvements to f-strings, including the ability to use the = sign to specify a minimum width for the formatted value, and the ability to use the !a, !s, and !r conversion specifiers to specify the representation of the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Performance improvements`: Python 3.8 includes a number of performance improvements, including faster dictionary and set operations, faster string concatenation and formatting, and faster attribute access.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other new features and improvements in Python 3.8, and it is worth exploring the documentation to learn more about what is new in this release.\n",
