    "`__getattribute__` is used to find an attribute of a class. It raises an AttributeError if it fails to find an attribute of a class. `__getattr__` is implemented latter if AttributeError is generated by `__getattribute__`, but for this `__getattribute__` and` __getattr__` both has to be defined in same class. If no attribute is found, `__getattr__` returns a default value. So key differece is that `__getattr__` is called for attributes that don't actually exist on a class."

    "\n",
    "In Python, `getattr()` is a built-in function that can be used to retrieve the value of an attribute of an object. It takes an object and an attribute name as arguments, and returns the value of the attribute. If the attribute does not exist, getattr() can raise an AttributeError exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "`getattribute()` is a special method that is called by Python whenever you try to access an attribute of an object. It is similar to getattr(), but it is called automatically when you try to access an attribute, rather than being called explicitly in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties are a way to define special methods that are called when you try to access an attribute of an object. They allow you to customize the behavior of attribute access for a specific attribute, and can be used to implement getters, setters, and deleters for the attribute.\n",
