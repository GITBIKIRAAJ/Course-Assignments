    "**Ans**: An abstract class/superclass can be considered as a blueprint for other classes. It allows US to create a set of methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class. A class which contains one or more abstract methods is called an abstract class Whereas an abstract method is a method that has a declaration but does not have an implementation"
