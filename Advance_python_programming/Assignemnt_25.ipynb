    "**Candlestick plot**: A candlestick plot is a graphical representation of stock data that shows the open, high, low, and close prices for a stock over a given time period. Candlestick plots are often used to visualize the price action of a stock and can provide valuable insights into market sentiment and trends.\n",

In a stock-market chart, indicator plots are often used to identify trends, overbought/oversold conditions, and other patterns that may not be immediately visible from the price and volume data alone."

    "\n",
    "**Ans**: Legend will help us in comparing different stocks in a stock market chart. Each plot of a Stock chart has a legend, its items representing the series on the plot. In addition, the legend displays information about the points that are currently hovered over or, if none are hovered over, about the last points shown on the plot. The text of a legend item includes the name of a series and, depending on the series type, the value or values of the current or last point. The legend title, enabled by default, shows the current or last date (X-value)."
