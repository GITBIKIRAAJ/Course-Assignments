    "1. **Prediction**: Machine learning is often used to make predictions about future events or outcomes. For example, a machine learning model might be used to predict the likelihood of a customer making a purchase based on their past behavior or to predict the likelihood of a patient developing a particular disease based on their medical history.\n",

    "3. **Clustering**: Machine learning can be used to group data into clusters or groups based on shared characteristics or patterns. For example, a machine learning model might be used to group customers into different segments based on their demographics or behavior.\n",

    "4. **Regression**: Machine learning can be used to predict a numerical value based on a given input. For example, a machine learning model might be used to predict the price of a house based on its features and location.\n",

    "In terms of the relationship between these goals and human learning, machine learning can be seen as an extension or application of human learning principles to the field of artificial intelligence. Many of the goals of machine learning, such as prediction and classification, are similar to goals that people have when learning new information. However, the specific methods and techniques used to achieve these goals in the context of machine learning can be quite different from those used by humans."

    "In Machine Learning, Abstraction is supported primarily at the level of modules. This can be justified in two ways: first, Data abstraction is mostly a question of program interfaces and therefore it arises naturally at the point where we have to consider program composition and modules. Abstraction is defined as dealing with ideas instead of events. In the context of AI, that means worrying more about what the right algorithm is and less about how to implement it. Another way of looking at it, for those technically inclined, is as an API call (abstracted) vs. a self implemented function or series of functions.   "

    "Generalization refers to your model's ability to adapt properly to new, previously unseen data, drawn from the same distribution as the one used to create the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example is when we train a model to classify between dogs and cats. If the model is provided with dogs images dataset with only two breeds, it may obtain a good performance. But, it possibly gets a low classification score when it is tested by other breeds of dogs as well. This issue can result to classify an actual dog image as a cat from the unseen dataset. Therefore, data diversity is very important factor in order to make a good prediction. In the sample above, the model may obtain 85% performance score when it is tested by only two dog breeds and gains 70% if trained by all breeds. However, the first possibly gets a very low score (e.g. 45%) if it is evaluated by an unseen dataset with all breed dogs. This for the latter can be unchanged given than it has been trained by high data diversity including all possible breeds.\n",

    "It should be taken into account that data diversity is not the only point to care in order to have a generalized model. It can be resulted by nature of a machine learning algorithm, or by poor hyper-parameter configuration. In this post we explain all determinant factors. There are some methods (regularization) to apply during model training to ensure about generalization. But before, we explain bias and variance as well as underfitting and overfitting."
