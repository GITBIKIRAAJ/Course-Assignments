The target function is the true relationship between the input and output variables, and the model that we learn is an approximation of this function. We train the model by using a training dataset that consists of input-output pairs, and the model is evaluated on a separate test dataset to see how well it performs at making predictions on unseen data.\n",

    "There are several different ways to assess the efficiency of a classification model, and the specific method used will depend on the characteristics of the dataset and the goals of the analysis. Here are some common methods for evaluating the performance of a classification model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: This is the most basic evaluation metric, and it simply measures the percentage of predictions that the model got right. For example, if a model correctly predicts the class label for 90 out of 100 examples, its accuracy is 90%. However, accuracy can be misleading if the classes in the dataset are imbalanced (i.e., one class is much more prevalent than the other).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Confusion matrix**: A confusion matrix is a table that shows the number of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions made by the model. It is a useful tool for understanding the types of errors that the model is making and identifying areas where it could be improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Precision and recall**: These metrics measure the ability of the model to correctly identify positive examples (precision) and the ability to find all positive examples (recall). They are often used in imbalanced classification problems, where it is important to avoid false negatives or false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **F1 score**: The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and it is a useful metric for comparing the performance of different models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AUC-ROC curve**: The AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve is a plot that shows the trade-off between the true positive rate and false positive rate of a classification model at different classification thresholds. The AUC-ROC score is the area under this curve, and it is a measure of the model's overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other evaluation metrics that can be used to assess the efficiency of a classification model, depending on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the goals of the analysis. It is important to choose the appropriate evaluation metric based on the needs of the problem, and to use multiple metrics to get a more complete understanding of the model's performance."

In this case, the model will be unable to learn the necessary patterns and relationships in the data, and it will perform poorly.\n",

    "Overfitting happens when a model is overly complex and is able to capture random noise and patterns in the training data that do not actually reflect the underlying relationship between the input and output variables. This means that the model will perform poorly on unseen data, as it will not be able to generalize the patterns it learned from the training data to new examples.\n",

    "- Having too few training examples relative to the complexity of the model\n",
    "- Using features that are not relevant to the target variable\n",
    "- Using a model with a high level of flexibility, such as a decision tree with a large number of branches\n",

If the true relationship is non-linear, the model will have a high bias and will perform poorly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Variance is the error`** that is introduced by the model's sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training data. A model with high variance is prone to overfitting, as it will be able to fit the training data very well but will not generalize well to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **bias-variance trade-off** refers to the fact that increasing the complexity of a model (e.g., by adding more features or increasing the capacity of the model) will generally reduce bias but increase variance.

The optimal model will strike a balance between bias and variance to achieve the best performance on the test set.\n",
